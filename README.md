# Recipe Improver Mod
 
### This mods allows you to remove recipes and have smelting recipes output an item count.
### You use this mod through datapacks.
 
## Usage:
To remove vanilla recipes you create a recipe json file in the minecraft namespace. The file has to have the same name as the vanilla recipe file and be a valid recipe file with a result value of "minecraft:air".
To add smelting, blasting or cooking recipes that output multiple items you create a "count" field with the desired value in the recipe file.
 
## Examples:
